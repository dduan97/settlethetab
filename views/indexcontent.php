  <p><b>SCENARIO</b> &nbsp; You and 7 friends go out to dinner. You all order
  dishes of varying prices and have a nice time. But when the check comes,
  you are in a bit of a pickle. To your dismay, the waitress informs you
  that <i>you may not split the check</i>. Glances shift around the table.
  There's an awkward silence. There's no choice - you step up and
  cover the entire meal. "You all owe m<a href="http://www.eelslap.com" style="text-decoration: none">e</a>," you announce to your friends.
  The order is incredibly complicated, and to make it worse, some have
  cash, some have credit, and no one seems to have the rig<a href="hello.html" style="text-decoration: none;">h</a>t amount
  of change. <b>What do you do?</b></p>
